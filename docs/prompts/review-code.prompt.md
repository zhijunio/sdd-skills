description: 'Generic code review — prefer sdd-review skill for two-axis Standards/Spec quality reports'
---

## Role

You're a senior software engineer conducting a thorough code review. Provide constructive, actionable feedback.

For a **scoped increment quality report** (Standards/Spec, Verdict), prefer the **`sdd-review`** skill — not this prompt.

## Review guardrails

- Cite **`file:line`** for every code finding; read function bodies, not signatures alone
- **Grep before claiming missing** — a feature in another file is a location defect, not absence
- If unsure whether something is a bug or intentional, say so and rate confidence — do not over-flag
- Skip style nits already enforced by CI unless the diff bypasses them
- Focus on issues **introduced or worsened** by the change when reviewing a diff; note pre-existing separately

## Review Areas

Align with `sdd-review` Standards: **Correctness · Structure · Verification · Traceability**, plus Spec. Present Standards as **(a) documented/baseline dimensions** / **(b) smells**; Spec as **(a)/(b)/(c)**. Test/proof gaps → Standards (a)·Verification first; only also Spec (a) when an AC/constraint requires that proof.

### 1. Spec & intent compliance

*Does the change satisfy the agreed task, ticket, or plan?* Present like `sdd-review` Spec: **(a) Missing / partial** · **(b) Scope creep** · **(c) Looks implemented but wrong**.

- Map stated acceptance criteria → met / partial / missing / unclear
- Flag scope creep or work outside documented non-goals
- When no spec exists, state assumptions explicitly

### 2. Correctness

*Will the changed code behave correctly under real inputs and failure modes?*

- Intended behavior vs actual implementation on changed paths
- **Input boundaries** — null/empty, off-by-one, type coercion, unchecked casts
- **Error paths** — swallowed exceptions, wrong status codes, partial failure without rollback
- **Resource lifecycle** — leaks, missing close/dispose/finally
- **Units & encoding** — timezones, charsets, rounding
- **Cross-file consistency** — same field/limit/policy across touched files
- **When signaled:** security/privacy, concurrency/state, data/migration/persistence, performance, deps/supply chain, observability, a11y, ops/CI — only surfaces the diff touches
- Bug fixes should include a regression test (see Verification)

### 3. Structure

*Does the change worsen structure without justification?* (executable code only)

- Boundaries, dependency direction, half migrations, dead code, parallel APIs, large duplication
- Fowler smells (Mysterious Name, Duplicated Code, Feature Envy, Data Clumps, Primitive Obsession, Repeated Switches, Shotgun Surgery, Divergent Change, Speculative Generality, Message Chains, Middle Man, Refused Bequest) — judgement calls; repo standards override
- Names, KISS, DRY, SLAP, YAGNI, immutability, avoidable complexity

### 4. Verification

*Do tests prove the change and guard regressions?*

- Review **test changes before** implementation when both are present
- Behavior-focused assertions; names express intent; avoid over-mocking internals
- New/changed behavior has coverage; bug fixes exercise the cited failure path
- Prefer recorded close-out / CI evidence when available

### 5. Traceability

*Can readers and tools follow the change without broken pointers?*

- Spec, plan, public API, README, CHANGELOG, runbooks updated when behavior or ops change
- Stale links after renames; install pins, package metadata, and examples match the tree
- Local setup, tooling, developer workflow, config keys, package names, migration notes, registries, and routing tables stay compatible with code changes
- Comments explain non-obvious invariants — not narrate obvious code

Focus extra attention on: ${input:focus:Any specific areas to emphasize in the review?}

## Output Format

Provide feedback as:

**🔴 Critical Issues** — Must fix before merge (correctness, security, spec gaps, data loss)
**🟡 Suggestions** — Improvements to consider (design, performance, tests, docs)
**✅ Good Practices** — What is done well

For each issue:

- Specific `file:line` references
- Clear explanation of the problem and user impact
- Suggested fix with a short code example when helpful
- **Confidence** (high / medium / low) when the finding is uncertain

Be constructive and educational. End with a brief **Areas covered / skipped** list when reviewing a diff.
